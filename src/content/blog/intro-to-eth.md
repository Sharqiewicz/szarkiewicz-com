# What's up, everyone!? ü§ô

If you are interested in cryptocurrencies you‚Äôve probably heard about Ethereum. Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain with Smart Contract functionality. It consists of two things, a state machine (Blockchain) üóÑÔ∏è and a single, canonical Ethereum Virtual Machine computer üñ•Ô∏è, or EVM for short. The state is stored in the blockchain and is changed through the EVM. The native cryptocurrency of the platform is Ether (ETH), which among other cryptocurrencies is second only to Bitcoin in market capitalization. As I‚Äôve mentioned at the beginning of the post, Ethereum allows you to create and execute programs called Smart Contracts but this will be discussed in future posts of the series.

## World‚Äôs computer

Ethereum is often referred to as the World's Computer üíª üò≤ and this statement makes a lot of sense. Ethereum has a blockchain state change log, which is stored in key-value format and acts more or less like RAM. Like a computer, Ethereum can load code into a state machine and run it. The difference between Ethereum and a regular computer is that changes to the Ethereum state are made according to consensus rules, and the state is globally distributed across all users. Cryptocurrency Ether is used to measure and reduce the cost of the operations performed in the blockchain.

## Origins, how does Bitcoin differ from Ethereum?

Ethereum was created by Vitalik Buterin, he believed that Bitcoin was too unsuitable for the development and development of projects based on it and there was a need for a technology that would be adapted to these requirements. In 2013, Vitalik started creating an article describing the foundations of Ethereum, and already in 2015 the first version of Ethereum called Frontier was released (more on that in the next article üòâ). Bitcoin is primarily a digital currency and developers can't do much with it, whereas Ethereum is tailored specifically for application development under this technology. This is how Ethereum differs from Bitcoin.

## Popularity

One of the main goals of Ethereum was for the technology to provide the ability to write applications in a complete language in the Turing sense. What set Ethereum apart was that developers were finally able to write fully-fledged decentralized applications (DApps) based on the technology. It is the EVM that interprets and executes code, in the form of Smart Contracts, that is the differentiator and one of the main advantages of Ethereum. This is why this technology has a huge fan base of developers.

## Why you should learn about Ethereum?

Learning about blockchains is very difficult because they combine many fields: programming, security, cryptography, distributed systems, economics, etc. Learning Ethereum is much easier, it is a great platform to learn blockchain technology, you start learning from a high level of abstraction and as you get to know it more and more you can go deeper into the details and of course the community around Ethereum is very large.

## Summary

So in nutshell, Ethereum is a blockchain that is changed by EVM and the operations are restricted by the internal cryptocurrency Ether. Programmers can easily create DApps (Decentralized apps) using the Ethereum network and it is the biggest feature of Ethereum which brought popularity to this technology. It‚Äôs open to everyone all around the world - so you can use it whenever you want.

And what are the development plans for Ethereum? That's in the next post...
